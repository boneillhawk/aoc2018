    "This is my record and commentary of the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018). I'm solving puzzles using Python 3, and when I can, I'm trying to stay up and solve each puzzle at midnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, I'm starting with the same template file. The template imports the following modules, which I've found useful for puzzles over the last two years:\n",
    "* ```copy``` -- Useful for deep copying states in complex search problem. I'll use this if A* search is required at any point.\n",
    "* ```collections``` -- Helpful if a puzzle calls for a stack or a queue, when a list won't cut it due to running time.\n",
    "* ```heapq``` -- Priority queues!\n",
    "* ```itertools``` -- I learned about this during the 2016 competition, and it is extremely useful. It won't be long before I'll use the ```permutations``` or ```combinations``` functions.\n",
    "* ```functools``` -- Useful for functions on functions. I'm not positive whether I've actually used this on a puzzle in the past, but when I need it, I'll be glad to have it.\n",
    "* ```math``` -- I'll need square roots eventually.\n",
    "* ```hashlib``` -- Advent of Code has used MD5 each of the last two years. This is prep for when that happens again."

I've also fixed the other two points I raised above, using a set and making a better ```if``` statement. Finally, instead of nesting the for loop inside a ```while True``` loop, the for loop now iterates over ```cycle(data)```. This function, from the ```itertools``` module, takes any iterable and makes it infinite by starting over when it reaches the end. Since the frequency doesn't duplicate in one pass through the list, this lets us keep repeating the list until the duplication happens."

The return statement uses slicing to build the string without the differing character. The solution still runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ time thanks to the ```combinations()``` call.
