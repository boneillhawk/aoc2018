    "This is my record and commentary of the [2018 Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2018). I'm solving puzzles using Python 3, and when I can, I'm trying to stay up and solve each puzzle at midnight.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each day, I'm starting with the same template file. The template imports the following modules, which I've found useful for puzzles over the last two years:\n",
    "* ```copy``` -- Useful for deep copying states in complex search problem. I'll use this if A* search is required at any point.\n",
    "* ```collections``` -- Helpful if a puzzle calls for a stack or a queue, when a list won't cut it due to running time.\n",
    "* ```heapq``` -- Priority queues!\n",
    "* ```itertools``` -- I learned about this during the 2016 competition, and it is extremely useful. It won't be long before I'll use the ```permutations``` or ```combinations``` functions.\n",
    "* ```functools``` -- Useful for functions on functions. I'm not positive whether I've actually used this on a puzzle in the past, but when I need it, I'll be glad to have it.\n",
    "* ```math``` -- I'll need square roots eventually.\n",
    "* ```hashlib``` -- Advent of Code has used MD5 each of the last two years. This is prep for when that happens again."

I've also fixed the other two points I raised above, using a set and making a better ```if``` statement. Finally, instead of nesting the for loop inside a ```while True``` loop, the for loop now iterates over ```cycle(data)```. This function, from the ```itertools``` module, takes any iterable and makes it infinite by starting over when it reaches the end. Since the frequency doesn't duplicate in one pass through the list, this lets us keep repeating the list until the duplication happens."

The return statement uses slicing to build the string without the differing character. The solution still runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ time thanks to the ```combinations()``` call.

    "For other problems, I have been able to eliminate the context of the problem to describe it. It doesn't seem possible here, so I've linked to the problem description in the header.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first problem is parsing the input and putting it in chronological order. Since each of the date and time components are fixed-width, I used string slicing to get the year, month, day, hour, and minute. I also used slicing to get the whole message after the date/time. I put all of the date/time information into a ```datetime.datetime``` object (side note: I hate this convention of module name and class name being the same) and stuck that object and the message inside a wrapper class which I called ```Info```. I defined the ```__lt__``` operation on ```Info``` so that I could use Python's built-in ```sorted()``` method to sort the list of ```Info``` objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the messages are in order, we need to process them. I keep track of two values, the current guard's ID (since only one guard is on duty) and what minute the guard last fell asleep. These are stored in ```current``` and ```start``` respectively. I also keep a ```sleeptime``` dictionary that maps guard IDs to a list of times they fell asleep in each minute (so the list has length 60 and is initialized to all zeros). I process each entry based on the first word in the message:\n",
    "* If the first word is **```Guard```**, I grab the ID number and update ```current```. If the guard is new, I add him to the dictionary with a \"spotless\" record of having never slept.\n",
    "* If the first word is **```falls```**, I grab the minute from this entry's datetime and store it in ```start```.\n",
    "* If the first word is **```wakes```**, I grab the minute from this entry's datetime and call it ```end```. I then increment every entry in the sleeptime dictionary for this guard between start and end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next loop uses the dictionary to find the sleepiest guard (the one whose sleep list has the largest sum). The loop after that searches that guard's list to find the minute where they most sleepy. We return the product of the guard's ID and the sleepiest minute.\n"

    "One of my students, Michael Hawes, sent me a nice regular expression to parse the input, which both avoids having to use ```datetime``` and the wrapper ```Info``` class. If we process each line with the statement ```re.findall(\"[\\w]+\", line)```, the line is converted into a tuple of the form: ```(year,month,day,hour,minute,word1,word2,...,word_n)```. One of the beautiful things about this is that we can sort the list of tuples and they will come out in chronological order. We can check for the same words we looked for above in the ```word1``` slot, knowing the Guard's ID will be in ```word2``` if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "So the optimized code below reads in the input using regular expressions (the ```re``` module). It also processes the input only once, combining the two parts into one function. If I wanted to optimize further, the two loops from part (a) could be combined with the two loops from part (b). However, I think this would make the code harder to understand."
